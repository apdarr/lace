    # Authentication helper for system tests.
    #
    # WHY VISITING /auth/strava/callback DIRECTLY WORKS:
    # In test mode OmniAuth bypasses the real Strava OAuth redirect & token exchange.
    # In the setup block above we:
    #   1. Provide a mock auth hash: OmniAuth.config.mock_auth[:strava]
    #   2. Inject it into the Rack env: Rails.application.env_config["omniauth.auth"]
    # When we visit the provider callback path, the OmniAuth middleware:
    #   - Detects the callback (/auth/strava/callback)
    #   - Supplies the mock hash as env['omniauth.auth'] (no network calls)
    #   - Hands control to our sessions handling code which creates the user/session & sets cookies
    # Result: One line gives every test a fully authenticated browser session without brittle UI
    # interactions (no clicking a "Continue with Strava" button, no redirect races).
    # If later you need variations, adjust the mock hash before calling login!.
    # (If multiple providers are added, make this accept a provider argument.)
